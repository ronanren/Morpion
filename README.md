<h1 id="welcome">Welcome</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m a student and this is my github with my programming projects.</p>
<p>“It’s not a bug, it’s a feature.”</p>
<h2 id="files">Files</h2>
<p>there are two files, the <strong>morpion</strong> is a Tic-tac-toe and the <strong>morpion-ia</strong> is a Tic-tac-toe with artificial intelligence.</p>
<h1 id="morpion">Morpion</h1>
<p>the game plays with the left click of the mouse.</p>

<p>and when I click on a square, the other player is invited to click and play.</p>

<p>to finish, when a player wins, the game stops with the message of the winning player and the game can start again thanks to the button “recommencer”.</p>
